## Hey! I'm Evan.


### 🙌 About 

I'm an incoming second year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in development in web and distributed systems, as well as competitive sport, esports, and anything inbetween!

Currently, I'm a Full Stack Developer @Heka-Health, and a Web Team Lead @Waterloop.

While mainly a JS/TS developer, I've been learning web technologies regarding Go. Currently looking for internships in summer 2022.
