## Hey! I'm Evan.


### ðŸ™Œ About 

I'm a second year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in development in web and distributed systems, as well as competitive sport and esports!

Currently looking for internships in Winter 2023.

While mainly a JS/TS developer, I've been learning web technologies regarding Go.
