## Hey! I'm Evan.


### ðŸ™Œ About 

I'm a first year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in a lot of development, competitive sports and esports, and anything inbetween!

While mainly a JavaScript developer, I've been learning web technologies regarding Python and Go. Currently looking for internships for summer term 2022.
