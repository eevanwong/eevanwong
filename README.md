## Hey! I'm Evan.


### ðŸ™Œ About 

I'm an incoming second year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I'm interested in a lot of development, competitive sports and esports, and anything inbetween!

While mainly a JS/TS developer, I've been learning web technologies regarding Go. Currently looking for internships in summer 2022.
